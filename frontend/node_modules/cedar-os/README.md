# Cedar-OS

**The framework for building AI-native applications**

Cedar-OS is an open-source React framework that enables you to build sophisticated AI-native applications with chat functionality, AI backend integration, and intelligent state management.

## Features

There are a few core features that make Cedar-OS special:

- üìä **Diff & History** - Show the user state changes the AI makes, allow user approve/reject, and manage history
- üó£Ô∏è **Voice Integration** - Voice-powered agent interactions
- @ **Mentions** - Mention system for user state to control agent context
- üé≠ **Spells** - Ways to interact with the agent outside of the chat

And, of course, we offer the building blocks needed to enable that:

- üîÑ **State Access** - Let agents read and write application state
- üí¨ **Chat Components** - Floating, SidePanel, Caption, or Embedded chat components
- ‚ö° **Streaming & Tool Calls** - Render real-time message streaming and agent tool execution
- ü§ñ **Agent Connection Modules** - Connect to various AI backends and services
- üé® **Component Library** - Pre-built UI components for AI-native interfaces
